// PRINT "Hello, World!" TO CONSOLE
print("Hello, world!")   // Print "Hello, world!"
print()                  // Print a blank line

// PRINT OTTHER THINGS
/* You can print all kind of thing into the console.
 For example, your name, your age, an icon that you like are all printable things. */
print("Hello,", "Do Duc Quan");   // Concatenate texts using colon
print("Your age is 20")
print("Your favorite emoji are üòÇ and ‚ù§Ô∏è")

/* You can stop the codeline with or without the semi-colon.
 However, if you use the semi-colon, you can write another codeline right after the previous one.*/
print(1+2); print(3)   // Print "3" twice, on separated lines
