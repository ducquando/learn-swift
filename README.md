Swift: the history and how to print "Hello, World!"

## 1. History

Swift was created on December 3, 2015, by Apple on the idea of a fun, easy, interacting but powerful programming language that has a general-purpose. Moreover, Swift is advertised to be safe (mistakes will be caught when compiling), fast (compared to C-based languages), and expressive (even kids want to code in Swift).<sup>1</sup>

Since Swift is made particularly by Apple for Apple users and developers, it is the one that developers must use to make apps for Apple’s devices such as iPhone, MacBook, and Apple Watch. Additionally, Xcode, a Swift's compiler, is made in a way that runs and previews the code’s result directly on an Apple device instead of a console or pop-up window like Python does.

There are many sources for developers who are investigating Swift. For general information, you can go to the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). For more details, you can visit [Swift's homepage](https://www.swift.org). For first-time programmers, Apple has an app called [Swift Playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/), which offers fun and interacting lessons on coding and building apps using Swift. Like other programming languages, Swift also has a detailed [documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and a public source code hosted on [Apple’s GitHub](https://github.com/apple) in case one wants to dig down into.


## 2. Getting Started

To run the code in this respository, you have to:
1. Have a Mac (you cannot run Swift from a Window or Linux device)
2. Have an Apple ID. If you have not created one, please visit [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com) and click on *Create Your Apple ID* on the top right of the screen. 
3. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on your Mac (once again, Xcode is an Apple-developed compiler for Swift). You can choose either *Download from Website* or *Download from Mac App Store*. For beginner, I'd recommend you *Download from App Store* for convinience as it will install the newest version along with all necessary tools. But if you choose *Download from Website*, you'll be able to choose the version (including both official and beta versions) you want to install.
5. Launch Xcode once it is installed successfully.

Once you have done all of steps, you are ready to run your first program in Swift, which is printing "Hello, World!" as suggested by the tradition.
