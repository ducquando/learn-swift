The history and how to print "Hello, World!" in Swift

## 1. History

Swift was created on December 3, 2015 by Apple on the idea of a fun, easy, interacting but powerful programming language that has general purpose. Moreover, Swift is advertised to be safe (mistakes will be caught when compiling), fast (compared to C-based languages), and expressive (even kids want to code in Swift). 

Since Swift is made particularly by Apple for Apple user and developer, it is the one that developers must use to make app for Apple’s devices such as iPhone, macbook and Apple watch. Additionally, Xcode, Swift complier, is made in the way that runs and previews the code’s result directly on an Apple device instead of a console or pop-up window like Java.

There are many sources for developer who is investigating in Swift. For general information, you can go to [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) where contains many introducing videos and download links. For more details, you can visit [Swift's homepage] (https://www.swift.org). For first time programmer, Apple has a software called [Swift Playground] (https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/), which offers fun and interacting lessons on how to code and build app using Swift. Like other programming languages, Swift also has a detailed [documentation] (https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and a public source code hosted on [Apple’s GitHub] (https://github.com/apple) in case one wants to dig down into.
