// You can compare boolean types with one another
print(true == false)  // False since true does not equal to false
print(true != false)  // True

// Or compare numbers
print(2 != 1)   // true

// r even strings
print("zebran" < "apple")  // false since character will be converted to ascii number, then they get compared
print("Zebran" < "apple")  // true since "Z" has smaller ascii number than "a"
