print("Your age is", Int(age));  // "Your age is 20"
print("Your favorite emoji is", emoji ?? "lovely face") // "Your favorite emoji is lovely face" since we have not assign anything to emoji, so it uses the default value "lovely face" instead

emoji = "ðŸ¥°"
print("Your favorite emoji is", emoji ?? "Lovely face") // "Your favorite emoji is ðŸ¥°" since this time we have assigned a value to the emoji variable
